## Privacy

Currently, our default LLM is a high performing model from Mistral AI: 7B.  This model possesses an Apache-2.0 License verifying its open sourced.  By default, the model is non-training, so your chats will never be monitored and/or used for further training of the model. When you delete your chats in settings, they are completely erased from the system.

This model gracefully handles a context of 8,000 Tokens which equates to about 5,000 words and you will be throttled to 1000 Messages Per Month.
